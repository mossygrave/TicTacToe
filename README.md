# TicTacToe
# Overview

This is a terminal based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players take turns trying to get three in a row.

I wrote this software to gain a better understanding of the C# programming language and to use as a refernce for future projects.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
